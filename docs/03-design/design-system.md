# Blog Platform Design System

## Design Philosophy

### Visual Language
**Editorial Sophistication**: Drawing inspiration from modern editorial publications like Kinfolk and The Gentlewoman, the design emphasizes clean lines, generous white space, and content-first hierarchy. The aesthetic balances professionalism with warmth, creating an inviting space for both reading and writing.

**Content-First Approach**: Every design decision prioritizes readability and content discovery. Visual elements serve the text rather than competing with it, using subtle animations and interactions to enhance rather than distract from the reading experience.

### Color Palette
**Primary Colors**:
- **Charcoal**: #2C2C2C (primary text, navigation)
- **Warm White**: #FEFEFE (background, cards)
- **Sage Green**: #8B9A7A (accent, links, buttons)
- **Soft Gray**: #F8F8F8 (section backgrounds, subtle dividers)

**Supporting Colors**:
- **Muted Gold**: #D4B896 (highlights, hover states)
- **Deep Forest**: #4A5D3A (dark mode accents)
- **Cream**: #FDFCF8 (alternative background)

### Typography
**Display Font**: Canela Bold (headlines, featured titles)
- Large, impactful headlines that command attention
- Used for main titles, featured post titles, and section headers
- Creates strong visual hierarchy and editorial feel

**Body Font**: Suisse Int'l (body text, navigation, UI elements)
- Clean, highly readable sans-serif for all content
- Excellent legibility at small sizes for long-form reading
- Modern, neutral character that doesn't compete with content

**Font Sizing Strategy**:
- Hero titles: 3.5rem (56px) - Bold, commanding presence
- Section headers: 2rem (32px) - Clear hierarchy
- Post titles: 1.5rem (24px) - Readable but prominent
- Body text: 1rem (16px) - Optimal reading size
- Meta text: 0.875rem (14px) - Subtle but legible
